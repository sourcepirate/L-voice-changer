## LVOICE CHANGER

I was playing around with audicity app today on my computer. In that app I was able to change my voice to *Death Note L's* Voice by overlapping multiple audiotracks at extreme pitches.

This project is an attempt to reproduce the same with FFMPEG and rust.

## Usage

```
cargo build

cargo run ../input.m4a .  # input file and output path

```

Once the run is complete you can able to see out.mp3 being generated by the binary. Which has your L's voice modulation.

## Using Lsplitter to morph voice in video

```
./lsplitter test.mp4

# will create morphed video as test-convert.mp4

```

## Debug

```
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run <in> <out>

```

To run in debug mode.
